# Progress Station

**Enjoy numbers going big in this quirky sci-fi auto-idler!**

---

In **Progress Station** you are the captain of a space station traveling through the vastness of space.

You configure modules, level up operations, grow your crew and explore space in a quirky and light-hearted science fantasy setting.

But be careful: bound to you by a sinister curse, an ultra powerful alien entity, known to some as _The Destroyer_, is ever looking for you.

If you like the world building of Adventure Time or the epic space saga of Gloryhammer you will feel right at home.
